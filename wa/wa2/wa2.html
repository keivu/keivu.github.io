    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div> 
        <p> Hi my name is Keira Vu. I am a sophomore Creative Tech and Design Major.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <div>
        <p> I'm really interested in the visual aspect of design. 
            I like organizing and arranging shapes and making things look 
            aesthetically pleasing. I also really like getting coffee and 
            hanging out with my boyfriend. When I'm not hanging out with him, 
            I'm with my roommates, and when I'm alone I'm listening to music
            and doing homework or scrolling.
        </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <div>
        <p> After college my boyfriend and I want to go to New York and open a cafe one day.
            I would also like to find an interesting and niche job, I think that would be fun.
