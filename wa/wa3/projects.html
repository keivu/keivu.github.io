    <h2>Figma Website User Interface Redesign</h2>
    <div>
        <p>This is a project that I had for Intro to Design last semester.
           The assignment was to get a screenshot of a difficult-to-use 
           interface, recreate it, and then redesign it in Figma. 
        </p>
        <p>Here is the Figma link to this project:</p>
