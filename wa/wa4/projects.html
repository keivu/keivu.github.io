    <div>
        <article tabindex="3">This is a project that I had in Intro to Design last semester.
           The assignment was to get a screenshot of a difficult-to-use 
           interface, recreate it, and then redesign it in Figma.

    <h3 tabindex="5">Figma Monument Website Design Group Project</h3>
    <div>
        <article tabindex="6">This was a final project for my Intro to Design class. 
           It was a group project with me and two other students.
           I was in charge of the theme and the layout, and created
           the welcome and team pages.The goal was to make a working
           interface for an imaginary monument that was theoretically
           somewhere on campus.
