      <p>The API I used was the Pokemon one that was mentioned in class. I used the name of the pokemon and its first type specifically. Some of them have more types, but I just used the first one.</p>
      <p>I'm using Spotify for my critique project. I know there's the Spotify API, but it's been said that that requires sign-in and authentication. If I can make that work, then I'd like to use it to perhaps create better and healthier habits and better genre selection for the users. But I'm also unsure of what else I could do to critique it well.</p>
